# Titanic Survival Prediction Using Neural Network in R ðŸš¢
This GitHub repository contains a Titanic Survival Prediction project implemented in R, utilizing a neural network model. This project aims to predict whether passengers on the Titanic survived or not based on various features such as age, gender, class, and more.

## Overview
The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there were not enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in a significant loss of life.

This project uses machine learning techniques and neural networks to predict whether a passenger survived the disaster or not. By analyzing the dataset containing information about the passengers, we aim to develop a model that can predict survival with a high degree of accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is provided in the directory. The Titanic-Dataset.csv file includes features like passenger class, age, gender, and the target variable 'Survived'. The dataset is split into test and train data on a ratio 70:30.
